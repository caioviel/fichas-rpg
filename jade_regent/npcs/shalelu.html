					<span class="tooltip">favored terrain (forest +2)
						<span class="tooltiptext">
							 The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).
						</span>
					</span>, 
					<span class="tooltip">Hunter's Bond (Companions)
						<span class="tooltiptext">
							 A ranger can spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.
						</span>
					</span>, 
					<span class="tooltip">terrain bond
						<span class="tooltiptext">
							 When in his favored terrain, the Ranger grants all allies within line of sight and that can hear him a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. Also, as long as they travel with him, the Ranger’s allies leave no trail and can’t be tracked. The Ranger can choose for the group to leave a trail, or even specific members of the group to leave a trail if he so desires.
						</span>
					</span>, 
					<span class="tooltip">track +3
						<span class="tooltiptext">
							 A ranger adds 3 to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.
						</span>
					</span>, 
					<!--span class="tooltip">Swift Tracker
						<span class="tooltiptext">
							 A ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal –5 penalty. He takes only a –10 penalty (instead of the normal –20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.
						</span>
					</span-->
					<span class="tooltip">wild empathy +4
						<span class="tooltiptext">
							 A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a –4 penalty on the check.
						</span>
					</span>
					<!--span class="tooltip">woodland stride
						<span class="tooltiptext">
							 A ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.
						</span>
					</span-->
				</br>
				<strong>Traits</strong>
					<span class="tooltip">Wild Stride
						<span class="tooltiptext">
							 You can move through naturally occurring difficult terrain without any penalty while within your favored terrain. Terrain created or modified by magic or traps affects you normally.
						</span>
					</span>, 
					<span class="tooltip">Courageous
						<span class="tooltiptext">
							 Your childhood was brutal, but you persevered through force of will and faith. No matter how hard things got, you knew you'd make it through as long as you kept a level head. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects.

		<h1>Background</h1>
		<p>
		<p> 
			Although Shalelu Andosana is something of a mystery in Sandpoint, she’s certainly one of the town’s most admired defenders. Like Sandru Vhiski, she doesn’t actually live in town, but she sometimes spends the night at the Rusty Dragon free of charge, thanks to her friendship with Ameiko Kaijitsu. Everyone in town knows that Shalelu is something of a loner and prefers to spend her time wandering and exploring the wilderness around Sandpoint. She periodically vanishes from the region for weeks or even months at a time to visit friends elsewhere in Varisia, but she never fails to return to Sandpoint. No one quite understands why she keeps coming back. When asked why, she merely says, “Someone’s got to keep an eye on you all.” Her reports of goblin activity have helped save folk from ambushes or warned the militia of possible attacks on the town or its farmlands numerous times. Yet in recent days, Sheriff Hemlock has taken a more active role in watching over the surrounding land. His militia is better trained than ever before, and Shalelu’s aid in keeping an eye on the hinterlands is growing less and less necessary. She actually seems relatively pleased with this, as if she’s proud that Sandpoint is finally starting to look after itself. She’s even hinted that she’s thinking of taking a long journey away from town sometime in the future, but when pressed for details, she just shrugs and changes the topic.
		</p>
		<p>
	Shalelu is still relatively young at 130 years of age, but she can remember when the Lost Coast was truly lost, when only goblin lairs and Thassilonian ruins could be found along its length. Yet for much of her life, Shalelu’s visits to southern Varisia were not nearly as common. Born and raised in the small village of Crying Leaf, Shalelu is an only child whose father was slain not long after she was born by a particularly brutal bugbear assassin, exposing Shalelu to far more goblinoid cruelty than most elves her age dream of in their worst nightmares. </p>
		<p>
It took Shalelu’s mother Seanthia nearly a hundred years to find a new love, and when she did, she chose a human mercenary, scandalizing much of Crying Leaf. As shocking as the choice may have been, Shalelu saw how happy this man Jakardos made her mother, and she loved him as a father for that kindness. But when her mother died in a fight a green dragon a few years later, Jakardos left without saying goodbye, shattering Shalelu’s opinion of him. The loss of her mother and stepfather sent Shalelu into a terrible depression, and she left Crying Leaf to seek out a new home. </p>
		<p>
Shalelu came to Sandpoint, where she found a burgeoning human village that was growing rapidly into a town, but that was plagued by goblins. Shalelu took Sandpoint under her wing, and for many years she protected it from goblins, bugbears, ghouls, and worse. Recently, Shalelu sought out Jakardos at his new home in central Varisia, and her reconciliation with her aging stepfather finally helped her come to terms with the violent attack that killed her mother. And when Shalelu returned to Crying Leaf to aid in dealing with the drow problem in the nearby Mierani Forest, she was able to help kill the same green dragon responsible for her mother’s death. </p>
		<p>
Shalelu is now in one of the happiest times of her life, and has been seized with a restless wanderlust. In recent years, Shalelu has built a strong friendship with Ameiko Kaijitsu as well, and sees her as a younger sister. Shalelu knows that Ameiko is haunted by tragedies, and in some ways sees a ref lection of her own sad history in Ameiko. Shalelu hopes to find some way soon of helping her friend overcome her melancholia—perhaps a nice long trip will fit the bill. </p>
		

		<h1>Relacionamentos</h1>
		<p>
			Shalelu é a irmã mais velha de Yori, e, apesar da saber das capacidades do garoto, ainda ge de maneira superprotetora com ele. Ameiko é uma grande amiga de Shalelu, por ter sido a primeira pessoa em Sandpoint que se mostrou simpática com a elfa sisuda. Apesar da personalidade das duas ser conflitante – Shalelu quieta e Ameiko falante – as duas são melhores amigas.
		</p>
			<p>
			Por outro lado, Shalelu não gosta e não confia em Zandalure. As duas nasceram na mesma vila e enquanto Shalelu se tornou uma espécie de protetora e heroína, Zandalure só queria se divertir e pregar peças nos demais – inclusive em Shalelu. Ela reconhece a habilidade da meia-elfa em arquearia, enfrentando, e a considera uma rival.
			</p>
	<p>
			Shalelu também não gosta de Skygni, o lobo do inverno que acompanha a caravana, pois acha que ele é um perigo para as pessoas indefesas da caravana.
